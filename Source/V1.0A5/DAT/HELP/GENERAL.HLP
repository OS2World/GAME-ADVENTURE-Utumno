General Information
The game of Utumno is a single player dungeon simulation.  A player may
choose from a number of races and classes when creating a character, and
then "run" that character over a period of days, weeks, even months,
attempting to win the game by defeating Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness,
who resides far below the surface.

The player will begin his adventure on the town level where he may acquire
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop
owners.  After preparing for his adventure, the player can descend into
the Pits of Utumno where fantastic adventures await his coming!

You will probably want to browse through the help files, especially the
one on available commands, before beginning any serious adventuring...

The basic help files supplied with this game are more or less up to date,
but when in doubt, the source (or the newsgroup) is the place to turn for
advice.  You can also try to figure it out by experimentation.  This is
sometimes the most fun.
