Fighting Monsters
%b+ Attacking and Being Attacked %b-
%br %br
If you move into a creature, you attack him.  You can attack from a distance
by firing a missile or by magical means such as aiming a wand.  Creatures
attack in the same way.  If they move into you, they attack you.  Some
creatures can also cast spells from a distance, and others can use various
breath weapons such as fire on you from a distance.
%br %br
Creatures in walls can not be attacked by wands and other magic attacks
normally stopped by walls.  You can attack a creature in a wall normally
by trying to move into the wall space containing the creature.  However, if
the creature is invisible (such as a ghost), you must tunnel into the wall
containing the creature.  If you just try to move into the wall, you will
bump your head and look quite silly.
%br %br
If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the weapon is used when you hit
a creature.  Otherwise you get a single punch which does little damage.
%br %br
You may wield both a primary weapon for melee combat, and a bow or other
missile launcher for launching missiles at the same time (along with a
light, an amulet, two rings, a helmet, boots, gloves, a shield, a cloak, and
body armor).  Be sure not to try and kill a dragon with a shovel, it makes
you look silly and probably won't work...
%br %br
Firing a missile while wielding the appropriate launcher is the only way to
get the "full" power out of the missile.  You may of course throw an arrow
at a monster without shooting it, but you will find the effects may not be
what you had hoped.
%br %br
Hits and misses are determined by ability to hit versus armor class.  A hit
is a strike that does some damage; a miss may in fact reach a target, but
fails to do any damage.  Higher armor classes make it harder to do damage,
and so lead to more misses; they also reduce the damage from a strike that
actually occurs.
%br %br
%b+ Monster Memories %b-
%br %br
There are hundreds of different creatures in the pits of Utumno, many of
which have the same letter symbol and color on the screen.  The exact species
of a creature can be discovered by looking at it.  It is also very difficult
to keep track of the capabilities of various creatures.  Utumno keeps track
of your experiences with a particular creature automatically.  This feature
is called the monster memory.  You monster memory recalls the particular
attacks of each creature (whether or not technically a monster) which you
have suffered, as well as recalling if you have observed them to multiply
or move erratically, or drop treasure, etc.  Otherwise you would simply
have to take notes, which is an unnecessary bother.
%br %br
If you have killed enough of a particular creature, or suffered enough
attacks, recalling the monster memory may also provide you with information
not otherwise available, such as a armor class or hit dice.  This memory
can be passed on to a new character even after you die by means of a
reduced save file.
%br %br
%b+ Your Weapon %b-
%br %br
Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you no good.  You must wield a weapon
before it can be used in a fight.  A secondary weapon can be kept by keeping
it in the backpack, and switching it with the primary weapon when needed.
%br %br
Weapons have two main magical characteristics, their enchanted ability to hit
and their enchanted ability to do damage, expressed as `(+#,+#)'.  A normal
weapon would be `(+0,+0)'.  Many weapons in Utumno have bonuses to hit
and/or do damage.  Some weapons are cursed, and have penalties that hurt the
player.  Cursed weapons cannot be unwielded until the curse is lifted.
Identifying a weapon will inform you of the magical bonuses and penalties
and whether or not it is cursed.
%br %br
Utumno assumes that your youth in the rough environment near the dungeons
has taught you the relative merits of different weapons, and displays as
part of their description the damage dice which define their capabilities.
Any damage enchantment is added to the dice roll for that weapon.  The dice
used for a given  weapon is displayed as "#d#".  The first number indicates
how many dice to roll, and the second indicates how many sides they have.  A
"2d6" weapon will give damage from 2 to 12, plus any damage bonus.  The
weight of a weapon is also a consideration.  Heavy weapons may hit harder,
but they are also harder to use.  Depending on your strength, dexterity,
character class, and weapon weight, you may get several attacks per turn.
%br %br
Missile booster weapons, such as bows, have their characteristics added to
those of the missile used, if the proper weapon/missile combination is used,
and the the launcher multiplier is applied to the total damage, making
missile weapons very powerful given the proper missiles, especially if they
are enchanted.
%br %br
Although you receive any magical bonuses an unidentified weapon may possess
when you wield it, those bonuses will not be added in to the displayed
values of to-hit and to-dam on your character sheet.  You must identify the
weapon before the displayed values reflect the real values used.
%br %br
Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities.  These are called ego
weapons, and are feared by great and meek.  An ego weapon must be wielded
to receive the benefit of its abilities.
%br %br
There are some very rare and well made blades in the dungeon that do not
necessarily have any special abilities. These include Blades
of Chaos, Maces of Disruption, and Scythes of Slicing.  They can also be
ego weapons.
%br %br
Various artifact weapons with great powers are also rumored to exist...
%br %br
%b+ Body and Shield Bashes %b-
%br %br
Weight is the primary factor in being able to bash something, but strength
plays a role too.  After bashing, a character may be off balance for several
rounds depending upon his dexterity.
%br %br
Doors can be broken down by bashing them.  Once a door is bashed open, it is
forever useless and cannot be closed.
%br %br
Finally, a creature may be bashed.  If a shield is currently being worn,
the bash is a shield bash and will do more damage.  In either case, a bash
may throw an opponent off balance for a number of rounds, allowing a player
to get in a free hit or more.  If the player is thrown off balance, his
opponent may get free hits on him.  This is a risky attack.
%br %br
%b+ Your Armor %b-
%br %br
Your armor class (or AC) is a number that describes the amount and the
quality of armor being worn. Armor class will generally run from about 0 to
150, but could become negative or greater than 150 with rarer armor or by
magical means.
%br %br 
The larger your armor class, the more protective it is.  A negative armor
class would actually help get you hit.  Armor protects you in three manners.
One, it makes you harder to be hit for damage.  A hit for no damage is the
same as a miss.  Two, good armor will absorb some of the damage that your
character would have taken from normal attacks.  Three, acid damage is
reduced by wearing body armor (but the armor will be damaged instead).  It
is obvious that a high armor class is a must for surviving the deeper levels
of Utumno.
%br %br
Each piece of armor has a base armor value, which, like the damage from
weapons, is assumed known by the player, and a magic bonus, which will not
be displayed unless the armor has been identified or was bought in a store.
%br %br
Armor class values are always displayed between a set of brackets as "[#]"
or "[#,+#]".  The first value is the armor class of the item.  The second
number is the magical bonus of the item which is only displayed if known,
and will always have a sign preceding the value.  Note that a few rings,
amulets, and weapons also have the "[+#]" notation, indicating that they
provide an armor bonus.  Many pieces of heavy body armor will also have a
"(-#)" before the "[#,+#]", which indicates that the weight of the armor
decreases your chances of hitting monsters.  This can range from nonexistent
for very light armor to (-8) for the very heaviest armor.
%br %br
Some pieces of armor will possess special abilities, just like ego weapons.
%br %br
Apart from these there are some very rare and well-made armors in the
dungeon with not necessarily any special abilities. These include Shields of
Deflection, Adamantite Plate Mail, Mithril Plate Mail, Mithril Chain Mail,
and Shadow Cloaks.  The first four cannot be damaged by acid because of the
quality metals they contain.
%br %br
Some very skilled weaponsmiths are rumored to have made armor out of the
scales of dragons. Such armor protects very well and allows you to resist
the elements that the same type of dragon breathes. It also cannot be
damaged by acid. In addition, it allows you to breathe just like a dragon...
%br %br
Pieces of artifact armor with great power are also rumored to exist...
