Utumno's Commands
Utumno allows you to control your character by using both the keyboard and
the mouse.  You need to know how to use both of these.
%br %br
Generally, the mouse is used for the most basic parts of the game: walking
around, picking up items, attacking monsters, opening and closing doors,
and so on.
%br %br
The keyboard is used for some other commands that do not particularily
work well with mice.  For example, it is easier to hit the 'i' key to
display your inventory than to use some complicated mouse technique.
%br %br
The keyboard commands map to a set of "console commands" through a process
called "binding."  This is beyond the scope of this document.
%br %br
%b+ Mouse commands %b-
%br %br
You can use the mouse to carry out a number of tasks.
%br %br
Walking %br
%indent+
    To walk to a tile, just click on it.  Your character will
    automatically begin walking in that direction.  Any commands will
    interrupt an automatic walk.  If a monster happens to be in your
    way, you will attack it, but you will not chase any monsters.  If
    you attempt to walk to a tile that you cannot be in (for example,
    a wall), nothing will happen.  The walking algorithm will go around
    simple obstacles, but it is not perfect.  Sometimes, you will need
    to instruct the game to do several walks to get to some tile.

%br %br
Fighting %br
%indent+
    To attack a monster, click on the tile it is on.  Instead of
    simply walking to that square, you will chase the monster until
    either it leaves your line of sight or it is dead.  When you are
    adjacent, you will automatically attack it.  Generally, this has
    the same properties as walking to a tile except for the chasing.
%br %br
    If you desire to attack a monster once and only once, shift-click
    on its tile when you are adjacent to it.  You will attack for one
    round only.

%br %br
Picking up objects %br
%indent+
    To pick up an object, walk to the tile it is on,
    and then shift-click on your character's tile.  You will pick up all the
    objects underneath yourself.  You cannot pick up objects in a tile
    other than the one your character is in.
%indent-
%br %br
Opening and closing doors %br
%indent+
    To open or close a door, shift-click on its
    tile when you are adjacent to that tile.  You cannot open or close
    a door you are not adjacent to, and you cannot close it when you are
    in its tile.
%indent-
%br %br
Using stairs %br
%indent+
    To go up or down some stairs, shift-click on their tile
    when you are adjacent to it.
%indent- %br %br
Disarming traps %br
%indent+
    To disarm a trap, shift-click on its tile when you are
    adjacent to it.
%indent- %br %br
Tunneling through walls %br
%indent+
    To tunnel through a wall or some rubble, shift-
    click on its tile when you are adjacent to it.
%indent- %br %br
Casting spells and using objects %br
%indent+
    The right button allows you to cast
    spells, zap rods, wands, and staves, activate artifacts, and fire
    your bow.  To do one of these things, you must first select the
    object you wish to use using various keyboard commands (see below).
    The commands are 'm' (Magic), 'z' (Zap), 'a' (Activate), and 'f'
    (Fire).  Once you have done this, right-click on the map where you
    wish to target your spell or ranged attack.  Spells without any
    target (for example, a teleport self spell) may be used by right-
    clicking at any location on the map.
